2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
SYNTH-9#1 Warning
Small multiplier  
Detected multiplier at Z_OBUF[10]_inst_i_1 of size 8x8, it is implemented as LUTs due to its small size. To force the multiplier onto a DSP block, use the USE_DSP48 attribute.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-9#2 Warning
Small multiplier  
Detected multiplier at Z_OBUF[10]_inst_i_13 of size 8x8, it is implemented as LUTs due to its small size. To force the multiplier onto a DSP block, use the USE_DSP48 attribute.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-9#3 Warning
Small multiplier  
Detected multiplier at Z_OBUF[14]_inst_i_1 of size 8x8, it is implemented as LUTs due to its small size. To force the multiplier onto a DSP block, use the USE_DSP48 attribute.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-9#4 Warning
Small multiplier  
Detected multiplier at Z_OBUF[14]_inst_i_21 of size 8x8, it is implemented as LUTs due to its small size. To force the multiplier onto a DSP block, use the USE_DSP48 attribute.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-9#5 Warning
Small multiplier
