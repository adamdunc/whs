open Vivado
create new project 
    Project Name: Name =  "student_P2", click next
    Project Type: keep default options for RTL Project, click next
    Add Sources: just click next
    Add constrains: just click next
    Default part: search for and select "xc7a35ticpg236-1l" then click next
    New Project Summary: cick finish
File>Add sources> select "Add or create design sources"> click next
Select "Create file", File name = "top", click finish
Define Module: add four ports as below and then click finish
    Port name = A, Direction = input
    Port name = B, Direction = input
    Port name = SUM, Direction = input
    Port name = CARRY, Direction = input
Now we have a top.v file created with our inputs and outputs to the half adder circuit
Next we tell Vivado to create logic gates to implement the half adder functionality using "assign statements"
Add the following two lines just before the endmodule line:
  assign SUM   = A ^ B;  // bitwise xor
  assign CARRY = A & B;  // bitwise and  

Now your top.v file should look like below:
module top(
    input A,
    input B,
    output SUM,
    output CARRY
    );
  assign SUM   = A ^ B;  // bitwise xor
  assign CARRY = A & B;  // bitwise and     
endmodule

File>Add sources> select "Add or create constraints">select "create file"> type "top" for name, click OK
Within sources window, expand "Constraints" to double click on "top.xdc"
Add the following lines to map ports to physical pins on the FPGA

set_property PACKAGE_PIN V17 [get_ports A]
set_property IOSTANDARD LVCMOS33 [get_ports A]
set_property PACKAGE_PIN V16 [get_ports B]
set_property IOSTANDARD LVCMOS33 [get_ports B]
set_property PACKAGE_PIN U16 [get_ports SUM]
set_property IOSTANDARD LVCMOS33 [get_ports SUM]
set_property PACKAGE_PIN E19 [get_ports CARRY]
set_property IOSTANDARD LVCMOS33 [get_ports CARRY]

Now you should have a completed top.v and top.xdc file.
Next step is to generate a bitstream.
Within Flow Navigator, click "generate bitstream" (note this may take 1-2 min to complete)
When this finishes, you should see a "bitstream complete" window pop up

From Vivado Flow Navigator window, click "open hardware manager"
At top of Hardware manager window, click "open target">autoconnect
At top of Hardware manager window, click "program device">select "top.bit" from student_p2.runs/impl_1
click program
you should see SW0,SW1 on BASYS3 make LED0,LED1 toggle like a half adder

questions:
1) what does the assign statement do?
2) what is the pupose of the xdc file?
